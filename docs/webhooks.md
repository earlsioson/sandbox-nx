# Design Review Note: Webhook Integration Justification

## **Business Requirement Context**

The NIV (Noninvasive Ventilator) onboarding workflow has **time-sensitive clinical requirements** that demand real-time data synchronization:

- **Patient Safety**: NIV qualification must be assessed promptly when new patients are admitted or when clinical status changes
- **Workflow Efficiency**: RT (Respiratory Therapist) assignments and notifications must trigger immediately to avoid delays in patient care
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Healthcare audit trails require accurate timestamps showing when data was received and processed
- **Care Coordination**: Multiple stakeholders (RT, Nurses, Administrators, DON, Unit Managers) need synchronized notifications

## **Technical Integration Requirements**

### **1. PointClickCare (PCC) Integration**

**Webhook Use Case**: Real-time EHR data synchronization

- **Lab Results**: New blood gas results that immediately affect NIV qualification decisions
- **Patient Status Changes**: Admissions, transfers, condition updates that trigger enrollment workflow
- **Clinical Documentation**: Updated diagnoses, physician orders, vital signs

**Alternative Considered**: Polling PCC API every 5-15 minutes
**Rejection Rationale**:

- Creates 5-15 minute delays in critical patient care decisions
- Higher API usage costs due to frequent polling of unchanged data
- Risk of missing time-sensitive clinical changes

### **2. Platform Application Integration**

**Webhook Use Case**: Cross-application event coordination

- **AXI Admit Application**: Immediate notification when patients are admitted who may need NIV assessment
- **Risk Legal Tool**: Real-time updates when patient risk profiles change
- **Reporting Compliance**: Immediate audit trail updates for regulatory requirements

**Alternative Considered**: Database polling or message queues
**Rejection Rationale**:

- Database polling creates tight coupling between applications
- Message queue infrastructure adds complexity for simple event notifications
- Webhooks provide loosely-coupled, standards-based integration

### **3. External System Triggers**

**Webhook Use Case**: Patient enrollment initiation

- External systems (EMR, nursing stations, physician orders) can trigger NIV enrollment
- Provides standardized HTTP-based integration point
- Enables future integrations without architectural changes

## **Technical Benefits**

### **Real-Time Performance**

- **Immediate processing**: 0-second delay vs. 5-15 minute polling intervals
- **Reduced API calls**: Only process actual changes vs. constant polling
- **Lower system load**: Event-driven processing vs. continuous background jobs

### **Scalability & Efficiency**

- **Bandwidth optimization**: Only receive data when changes occur
- **Processing efficiency**: No wasted CPU cycles checking for non-existent changes
- **Cost optimization**: Reduced API usage costs with external systems

### **Reliability & Monitoring**

- **Webhook retry mechanisms**: Built-in delivery guarantees with exponential backoff
- **Audit trail**: Complete record of when external events occurred
- **Error handling**: Immediate notification of integration failures

## **Healthcare Industry Standard**

Webhooks are **industry standard** for healthcare integrations:

- **HL7 FHIR**: Modern healthcare interoperability standard supports webhook subscriptions
- **EHR Systems**: Most major EHR vendors (Epic, Cerner, Allscripts) provide webhook capabilities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Real-time audit trails are preferred for healthcare compliance

## **Risk Mitigation**

### **Webhook Failure Handling**

- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with maximum retry attempts
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed webhooks stored for manual processing
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Immediate notification of webhook failures
- **Fallback Polling**: Emergency polling mode if webhook delivery fails consistently

### **Security Implementation**

- **Webhook Signature Verification**: HMAC signature validation for all incoming webhooks
- **HTTPS Only**: All webhook endpoints require TLS encryption
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict webhook sources to known, trusted systems
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent webhook abuse and system overload

## **Implementation Complexity**

**Webhooks are simpler** than alternatives:

```typescript
// Webhook approach (simple)
@Post('/webhooks/patient-added')
async handlePatientAdded(@Body() data: PatientData) {
  await this.enrollmentService.initiateEnrollment(data);
}

// vs. Polling approach (complex)
@Cron('*/5 * * * *') // Every 5 minutes
async pollForChanges() {
  const newPatients = await this.pccService.getNewPatients();
  const updatedPatients = await this.pccService.getUpdatedPatients();
  // Complex state management to track what was already processed...
}
```

## **Recommendation**

**Approve webhook integration** as the primary integration pattern for NIV system because:

1. **Clinical Requirements**: Real-time patient care demands cannot accept 5-15 minute delays
2. **Industry Standard**: Aligns with modern healthcare interoperability practices
3. **Technical Efficiency**: More performant and cost-effective than polling alternatives
4. **Future-Proof**: Enables additional integrations without architectural changes
5. **Risk Managed**: Comprehensive failure handling and security measures included

**Alternative Integration Methods** (polling, queues, database triggers) should be **reserved for specific use cases** where real-time processing is not required or where external systems do not support webhooks.
